# Fibonacci Series
Solving Fibonacci using Brute Force technique uses _O(2 <sup>n</sup>)_ time complexity and _O(2<sup>n</sup>)_ space complexity
Solving is with Dynamic Programming solves it in _O(n)_ time complexity and _O(n)_ space complexity, resulting in a significant increase in performance.

# Grid Traveller
>We are given a m * n matrix and our job to the find the number of ways a traveller can travel from the starting position to the end of the matrix.

Normally we can solve this problem using brute for in _O(2<sup>m+n</sup>)_ time complexity.
Whereas implementing DP the problem gets solved in _O(m+n)_ time complexity.
